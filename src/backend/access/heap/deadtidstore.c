 * Whenever we perform the first pass of the vacuum we flush the dead items to
 * the conveyor belt multiple times, but the complete pass over the heap is
 * considered as a single vacuum run in the conveyor belt and all the tids of a
 * single run is in sorted order because during vacuum we scan and prune the
 * heap in the block order.
 *
 * So while performing the first vacuum pass it is also possible that we
 * encounter the same deadtid again which we already inserted into the conveyor
 * belt in one of the previous vacuum run.  ButÂ there is no way to identify
 * whether that is already there in the conveyor or not except for checking it
 * in the conveyor belt itself.  However the whole conveyor belt data might
 * not fit into the maintence_work_mem and that makes it difficult to search
 * individual item in the conveyor belt.
 *
 * But since we know the fact that the individual vacuum runs in the conveyor
 * belt are sorted so we can perform a merge over each run in order to generate
 * a sorted data.  For that we maintain a cache over each run and pull a couple
 * of pages in the cache from each run and then merge them into a block-level
 * cache.  The block-level cache is a very small cache that only holds the
 * offsets for the current block which we are going to prune in the vacuum.
 *
 * This data structure maintains the current state of the cache over the
 * previous vacuum runs.
